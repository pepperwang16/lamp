<!-- Design Evolution -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Design Evolution</h2>

  <p>
    Based on findings from the low-fidelity prototype testing and peer feedback, 
    the Calm-Tech Lamp design underwent several important revisions before developing 
    the computer prototype. These changes focused on improving clarity, intuitiveness, 
    and the overall calm interaction experience.
  </p>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Consolidation of Interaction Model</h3>
    <p>
      The previous test result revealed that users preferred fewer, clearer gestures. 
      In the computer prototype, we streamlined these into simple, distinct interactions: 
      <em>click</em> to switch modes, <em>slider or arrow keys</em> to adjust brightness, 
      and <em>knob rotation</em> to set focus duration. This reduced confusion and supported 
      faster learnability observed in testing.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Enhanced Visual Feedback Consistency</h3>
    <p>
      In the lo-fi tests, participants reported that some light cues were hard to distinguish 
      (e.g., focus vs. break colors) and that transitions were too abrupt. The computer prototype 
      introduced smoother gradient transitions and standardized color mapping — 
      <strong>amber for focus</strong>, <strong>blue for break</strong>, 
      <strong>yellow for lamp</strong> — ensuring better recognition and comfort 
      during prolonged use.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Refinement of Brightness and Timer Controls</h3>
    <p>
      Lo-fi feedback showed that participants often over-adjusted brightness or forgot to start 
      the Pomodoro timer. The digital prototype introduced finer brightness control and visible 
      timer confirmation to provide reassuring feedback while maintaining minimal cognitive load.

  <!-- Participants for Testing -->
  <div class="section" style="margin-top:20px">
    <h3>Participants for Testing</h3>

    <p>
      To ensure that the usability testing reflects realistic and representative interactions with the Calm-Tech Lamp, 
      participants will be recruited primarily from the McGill University community.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Number of Participants:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We plan to recruit 2–3 undergraduate or graduate students and 1–2 researchers or office professionals, for a total of approximately 3–5 participants.</li>

    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- Usability Goals -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Usability Goals</h2>

  <p>Based on feedback from the previous low-fidelity prototype and the current stage of the Calm-Tech Lamp’s development, the usability goals focus on evaluating how effectively the system supports users in managing focus and break cycles using the Pomodoro technique, while also providing calm weather awareness through subtle visual cues. The overarching objective is to ensure that the lamp delivers non-intrusive, intuitive guidance that enhances focus and situational awareness without requiring constant digital interaction or visual attention.</p>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Ease of Use</h3>
    <p>Users should be able to perform all essential interactions such as starting or stopping a focus session, adjusting brightness, and interpreting weather updates within the first 10 minutes of use, with little to no external instruction. Success will be measured by the percentage of participants who complete all benchmark tasks on their first attempt and the time taken for each, confirming that the Calm-Tech Lamp’s interactions are straightforward, efficient, and user-friendly.</p>
    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The Calm-Tech Lamp web prototype is designed to reduce cognitive load and minimize the need for active digital interaction. Its controls clicking the dome to change modes, dragging the knob or using the left/right arrow keys to adjust focus duration, and sliding or using the up/down arrow keys to control brightness are intended to feel natural and intuitive. Users should be able to perform these actions comfortably and confidently within their first session, without requiring detailed instructions or prior experience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Learnability</h3>
    <p>First-time users should be able to understand the meaning of the lamp’s color cues and animations and remember how to use each interaction method clicking the dome to change modes, dragging the knob or using the left/right arrow keys to set focus duration, and adjusting brightness through the slider or up/down keys after a single session. We will evaluate learnability by asking participants to recall the purpose of each mode and interaction at the end of the test.</p>
    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> As a calm-technology interface, the lamp’s visual feedback should be self-explanatory and memorable. Users should not need written instructions or repeated demonstrations to operate it effectively. The goal is for them to rely on intuitive color cues and smooth animations to understand state changes and controls naturally.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Error Accommodation</h3>
    <p>The Calm-Tech Lamp web prototype should minimize user errors such as clicking the wrong mode, misunderstanding the current state, or accidentally resetting the focus timer. We aim for no more than two interaction errors per session per user, and users should be able to recover easily without external assistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> A calm-technology interface should prevent frustration and confusion by providing clear, immediate visual feedback. Each interaction gives a confirming cue such as a brief glow pulse when changing modes or a smooth color transition that clarifies whether the lamp is in Lamp (yellow), Focus (amber/orange), Break (blue), or Weather (purple or weather-based color) mode. These responses help users recognize successful inputs instantly and correct mistakes intuitively, without disrupting their focus session or needing to restart the system.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Utility</h3>
    <p>All implemented features — including the focus timer, break indicator, brightness adjustment, and weather awareness display — must be perceived as useful and relevant to the user’s daily workflow. Participants will rate the usefulness of each feature on a 5-point Likert scale. A successful design will achieve at least 80% positive ratings (4 or 5 out of 5).</p>
    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> The Calm-Tech Lamp’s core purpose is to deliver meaningful, glanceable feedback that enhances focus and situational awareness without requiring active attention. Each mode fulfills a distinct and practical role: the soft yellow lamp mode provides ambient comfort, the amber focus mode encourages concentration through gradual progress cues, the cool blue break mode signals rest, and the weather mode conveys real-world conditions. When users intuitively recognize and appreciate these cues, the lamp fulfills its calm-technology goal of unobtrusive assistance that harmonizes with daily life rather than disrupting it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>User Satisfaction</h3>
    <p>Participants should report overall satisfaction with the Calm-Tech Lamp’s visual aesthetics, interaction simplicity, and calm feedback experience. User satisfaction will be measured through post-test surveys and short interviews, aiming for an average rating of at least 4 out of 5 on clarity, comfort, and pleasantness to confirm that the lamp provides an enjoyable, intuitive, and soothing user experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> Positive emotional response is central to calm design; the Calm-Tech Lamp should evoke a sense of control, focus, and relaxation through soft lighting, smooth color transitions, and intuitive interactions. The warm amber focus light, cool blue break light, and distinct weather-based tones should remain balanced and non-distracting, while adjustable brightness and duration enhance comfort and autonomy, collectively fostering well-being and calm productivity rather than pressure or visual fatigue.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>User Comfort and Safety</h3>
    <p>Users must feel visually comfortable while interacting with the Calm-Tech Lamp for extended periods of focus and rest. The study will ask whether any light transitions, brightness levels, or color changes caused distraction, eye strain, or discomfort during use, ensuring that all on-screen interactions such as adjusting brightness with the slider or arrow keys and observing smooth transitions between lamp, focus, break, and weather modes—remain gentle and non-intrusive. Because the prototype relies on light as its primary feedback mechanism, maintaining visual comfort is essential; brightness levels, color shifts, and animation speeds must stay subtle, gradual, and balanced to prevent fatigue.</p>
    <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> As a calm-technology system, the lamp’s lighting feedback should encourage relaxation, focus, and awareness without overwhelming the user. Subtle animations and balanced brightness transitions create an ambient and reassuring environment that supports productivity and mental well-being. By ensuring that color cues remain soft and consistent, the Calm-Tech Lamp provides a safe and pleasant digital experience suitable for long-term use.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Benchmark Tasks</h3>
    <p>Having established the usability goals for the Calm-Tech Lamp, we now define specific benchmark tasks that reflect the system’s key interactive functions. Each task is designed to simulate real-world scenarios, such as managing focus sessions using the Pomodoro technique, adjusting ambient lighting for comfort, and staying aware of weather conditions through subtle color cues. Participants will complete each task without detailed instructions, allowing examiners to observe how naturally they interpret and use the lamp’s interactive features such as clicking the dome to change modes, rotating the on-screen knob to set focus time, and using the slider or arrow keys to adjust brightness. This approach ensures that the evaluation focuses on intuitive understanding, visual feedback clarity, and the overall calmness of the user experience.</p>

<!-- Usability Test Procedure -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Usability Test Procedure</h2>

  <p>Having finalized the usability goals and benchmark tasks for the Calm-Tech Lamp computer prototype, we will now conduct a usability test to evaluate the prototype’s performance and intuitiveness. Each session will last approximately 10–15 minutes, during which participants will interact with the prototype and complete specific tasks related to focus-time management (Pomodoro) and weather-change awareness.</p>

  <!-- Number of Examiners Required -->
  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Number of Examiners Required</h3>
    <p><strong>Facilitator</strong> – Introduces the session, starts the prototype, and guides the participant through the tasks without offering direct assistance.</p>
    <p><strong>Observer</strong> – Records task completion times, behaviors, and qualitative feedback during the test.</p>
    <p>Because the Calm-Tech Lamp test is low-risk and stationary, a single examiner may perform both roles when resources are limited (facilitate and take structured notes with the observation sheet).</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Equipment Required -->
  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Equipment Required</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Laptop or desktop with a modern browser (Chrome / Safari / Firefox) capable of running the React-based prototype online (Vercel link).</li>
      <li>Stable internet connection (for weather updates and location-based data).</li>
      <li>Stopwatch or timing software to record task times and session duration.</li>
      <li>Observation sheet or spreadsheet to note performance, errors, and reactions.</li>
      <li>Screen recording software (optional) for post-test review.</li>
      <li>Post-test survey form (Google Form or printed questionnaire).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Prototype Handling -->
  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Prototype Handling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Launch the prototype in full-screen mode.</li>
      <li>Confirm interactions (tap/click, rotation, tilt or arrow keys) function correctly.</li>
      <li>Ensure ambient lighting allows color feedback to be clearly visible.</li>
      <li>Refer to the user manual if issues occur, but do not provide extra instructions to participants.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Examiner Instructions -->
  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>Examiner Instructions</h3>

    <h4>Observer Briefing</h4>
    <p>Quietly monitor how the participant:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Interprets lamp cues and interacts without prior instruction.</li>
      <li>Uses mouse/keyboard to simulate gestures (click dome to change modes; drag on-screen knob to adjust focus time; arrow keys/scroll for brightness).</li>
      <li>Reacts to color/animation feedback (start/end of focus, weather change).</li>
      <li>Shows confusion or hesitation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Record: task completion time, number of incorrect actions/errors, verbal comments or visible signs of confusion. Avoid interference unless comfort or safety is compromised.</p>

    <p><em>User Introduction Script:</em><br>
      “Thank you for joining our usability test. Today, you’ll be evaluating the Calm-Tech Lamp, a smart desk companion that helps manage focus sessions and provides subtle weather notifications. We’re testing how easy it is to understand and use the lamp’s features.<br>
      There are no right or wrong actions — we just want to see how naturally you interact with it. Please think aloud as you perform the tasks.<br>
      The session should take less than 15 minutes, and we’ll ask for your feedback afterward. Sound good?”</p>
    <p>Participants will then sign a consent form and are reminded they may stop at any time.</p>

  <!-- 1. Recording Procedure -->
  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>1. Recording Procedure</h3>
    <p>During each session, two examiners will observe and record both quantitative and qualitative data as participants complete the six benchmark tasks. All sessions should be video-recorded (including screen interactions and lamp color feedback) to support post-session analysis.</p>

    <h4>a. Quantitative Data (Objective Measures)</h4>
    <p>Each task will be logged using a standardized observation sheet or digital form (e.g., Google Sheets or Notion). The following metrics will be captured in real time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Task completion time (start to finish for each benchmark task)</li>
      <li>Number of errors or incorrect actions (e.g., wrong control, missed interaction)</li>
      <li>Assistance required (none, minimal, major)</li>
      <li>Success rate (completed vs. incomplete)</li>
      <li>Accuracy of interpretations (e.g., correct weather color identification)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Each entry should include:</strong> Participant ID, Task #, Time (s), Errors, Assistance Level, Success (Y/N)</p>

    <h4>b. Qualitative Data (Subjective Feedback)</h4>
    <p>Immediately after each task, examiners will note participant comments, visible hesitation, and emotional reactions (e.g., confusion, satisfaction, surprise). At the end of the session, participants will complete a short post-test questionnaire rating:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ease of use</li>
      <li>Visual clarity of feedback</li>
      <li>Comfort level of brightness</li>
      <li>Understanding of mode transitions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(using a 5-point Likert scale)</p>
  </div>

  <!-- 2. Reporting Format to the Design Team -->
  <div class="section" style="margin-top:16px">
    <h3>2. Reporting Format to the Design Team</h3>
    <p>After data collection, examiners will summarize findings for each participant and consolidate results across all sessions into a Usability Evaluation Report that includes:</p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Section</th>
        <th>Content</th>
